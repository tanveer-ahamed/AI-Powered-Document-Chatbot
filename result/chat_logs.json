    "raw_answer": "General Fire Safety (Page 12): Smoking around or nearby the Enertainer is prohibited.\n\nFire Suppression System (FSS) (Page 17, 18, 19):  The FSS is an automated system that detects and suppresses fire using smoke and heat sensors.  It includes a fire extinguisher (using aerosol technology with a dry solid extinguishing agent, effective on gas and liquid fires in electrical equipment; no toxic substances or increased air pressure risk; Page 17), a fire alarm control panel (FACP; located behind the control door; controls sensors, alarm, and extinguisher triggers; Page 18), a status indicator (located at the front; allows monitoring and manual extinguisher release; Page 19), and smoke and heat sensors (Page 17).  When multiple sensors are activated, the extinguishant is released (Page 18).  Extinguishers are installed in both AC and DC sections and activate together upon signal (Page 17). CAUTION: Do not stand near any fire extinguisher before or during release due to high temperature risk of injury (Page 18).",
    "final_answer": "**General Fire Safety:**  Smoking is strictly prohibited in the vicinity of the Enertainer (Page 12).\n\n**Fire Suppression System (FSS):** The Enertainer incorporates an automated Fire Suppression System (FSS) designed to detect and suppress fires.  This system comprises several key components detailed below:\n\n* **Fire Extinguisher:** An aerosol-based fire extinguisher utilizing a dry solid extinguishing agent is integrated into the FSS (Page 17). This extinguisher is effective against gas and liquid fires, including those involving electrical equipment.  Importantly, it employs a non-toxic agent and does not pose a risk of increased air pressure (Page 17).  Extinguishers are installed in both the AC and DC sections of the Enertainer and are designed to activate simultaneously upon receiving a signal (Page 17).\n\n* **Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP):** The FACP is located behind the control door and serves as the central control unit for the FSS (Page 18). It manages the sensors, the fire alarm, and the activation of the fire extinguisher.\n\n* **Status Indicator:** A status indicator is situated on the front of the Enertainer, enabling monitoring of the FSS and providing the option for manual extinguisher release (Page 19).\n\n* **Smoke and Heat Sensors:**  Smoke and heat sensors are integral components of the FSS (Page 17).  Activation of multiple sensors triggers the release of the extinguishing agent (Page 18).\n\n**CAUTION:**  To avoid the risk of serious injury from high temperatures, personnel must not stand near any fire extinguisher before or during its deployment (Page 18).",
